Quick n dirty CLI for checking ec2 inventory

Specifically design for my own personal workflow.

If you're doing something serious, you should look into these better
alternatives:

* https://github.com/DrGonzo65/ec2-cli-tools - very similar package that lets
  you glob
* https://github.com/mattrobenolt/ec2 - lets you query instances using django-
  orm-like syntax
* awscli - official aws cli
